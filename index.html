        <p class="lead">A collection of awesome maps from Twitter.</p>
      </div>

    <p>
      There have been so many awesome maps shared as part of #30DayMapChallenge,
      but they've been dispersed across Twitter. I thought I'd try to collate them
      so they're all in one place and somewhat explorable. I'm looking forward
      to catching up on the ones I missed and coming back time and again for
      inspiration. Hopefully you enjoy them to. Thanks to everyone who took part!
    </p>
    <h3>Where are the maps?</h3>
    <p class="text-info">
      Click through to the
      <a href="maps.html">map gallery</a>
      where you can explore all* the maps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interface allows you to filter by challenge days and the
      areas being mapped, as well as other metadata - the types of
      maps and the tools used (where they've so far been classified).
      Click on a map card to see the full image, and to link through
      to the original tweet and the creator's webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you might expect, loading the full page and looking at every map in detail
      will load 10s or 100s of MB of data, but the images are loaded lazily
      so you don't have to download it all at once!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have trouble with the gallery, or don't like the approach,
      Aurelien Chaumet took a different (but still really awesome) approach
      <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/aurelien.chaumet#!/vizhome/30daymapchallenge/30DayMapChallenge-Week1?publish=yes">collating them all in Tableau.</a>
    </p>
    <h3>How did the challenge start?</h3>
    <p>This was all started by Topi Tjukanov in Finland:</p>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
      <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
        Announcing #30DayMapChallenge in November 2019!
        Create a map each day of the month with the following themes
        <br/>
        <br/>
        No restriction on tools. All maps should be created by you.
        Doing less than 30 maps is fine. #gischat #geography #cartography #dataviz

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      People know a good idea when they see one, and hundreds of people
      from around the globe took part to have some fun and improve their
      map making skills.
    </p>
    <h3>How many people took part? What were the most popular countries?</h3>
    <p>
      Take a look at the
      <a href="stats.html">stats page</a>
      (though it needs a bit more data at this stage).
    </p>
    <h3>Can I help complete the metadata for the maps?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, of course!
      I'm happy to accept corrections to mistakes or additional metadata
      via email (myname at frigge.nz) or
      <a href="https://github.com/dakvid/30DayMapChallenge">Github</a>
      issues or pull requests.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a map is missing from the gallery then it should be in my
      todo list (actually a todo data frame) and will appear soon.
      The most helpful area to crowdsource is the metadata on areas,
      topics, types and tools. My source data file
      <a href="https://github.com/dakvid/30DayMapChallenge/blob/master/data/map_classification.tsv">is here</a>
      - please feel welcome to fill in any of the gaps.
    </p>
    <h3>Who are you?</h3>
    <p>
      I'm
      <a href="https://david.frigge.nz/about">David Friggens</a>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/dakvid">(@dakvid)</a>
      - just another guy on Twitter with an interest in maps.
      I had other commitments in early November so only managed 9 maps
      in the second half, but wanted to see more of what everyone else
      made as there have been so many amazing maps.
    </p>
    <h3>How did you make this site?</h3>
    <p>
      It's the
      <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 4</a>
      theme
      <a href="https://bootswatch.com/lux/">Lux.</a>
      The gallery was made with
      <a href="https://vestride.github.io/Shuffle/">shuffle.js</a>
      and
      <a href="https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes">lazysizes.</a>
      The final product is cobbled together with some rough
      <a href="https://github.com/dakvid/30DayMapChallenge">R code.</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Is a FAQ style the best way to structure this page?</h3>
    <p>No, probably not.</p>
